	abstract = {Segmentation is a fundamental feature of the vertebrate body plan. This metameric organization is first implemented by somitogenesis in the early embryo, when paired epithelial blocks called somites are rhythmically formed to flank the neural tube. Recent advances in in vitro models have offered new opportunities to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie somitogenesis. Notably, models derived from human pluripotent stem cells introduced an efficient proxy for studying this process during human development. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of somitogenesis gained from both in vivo studies and in vitro studies. We deconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of somitogenesis into four distinct modules: dynamic events in the presomitic mesoderm, segmental determination, somite anteroposterior polarity patterning, and epithelial morphogenesis. We first focus on the segmentation clock, as well as signalling and metabolic gradients along the tissue, before discussing the clock and wavefront and other models that account for segmental determination. We then detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms of anteroposterior polarity patterning and somite epithelialization.},

	abstract = {Sequential segmentation creates modular body plans of diverse metazoan embryos1–4. Somitogenesis establishes the segmental pattern of the vertebrate body axis. A molecular segmentation clock in the presomitic mesoderm sets the pace of somite formation4. However, how cells are primed to form a segment boundary at a specific location remains unclear. Here we developed precise reporters for the clock and double-phosphorylated Erk (ppErk) gradient in zebrafish. We show that the Her1–Her7 oscillator drives segmental commitment by periodically lowering ppErk, therefore projecting its oscillation onto the ppErk gradient. Pulsatile inhibition of the ppErk gradient can fully substitute for the role of the clock, and kinematic clock waves are dispensable for sequential segmentation. The clock functions upstream of ppErk, which in turn enables neighbouring cells to discretely establish somite boundaries in zebrafish5. Molecularly divergent clocks and morphogen gradients were identified in sequentially segmenting species3,4,6–8. Our findings imply that versatile clocks may establish sequential segmentation in diverse species provided that they inhibit gradients.},

Phenotypic strength is further augmented by low temperature and hypoxia. By performing live imaging of the segmentation clock reporters, we further show that groups of cells with higher oscillation amplitudes successfully form somites while those with lower amplitudes fail to do so. In unfavorable environments, the number of cycles with high amplitude oscillations and the number of successful segmentations proportionally decrease. These results suggest that individual oscillation cycles stochastically fail to pass a threshold amplitude, resulting in segmentation defects in mutants. Our quantitative methodology is adaptable to investigate variable phenotypes of mutant genes in different tissues.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process1,2; however, organismal development and homeostasis require cells to coordinate the spatiotemporal expression of large sets of genes. In metazoans, pairs of co-expressed genes often reside in the same chromosomal neighbourhood, with gene pairs representing 10 to 50\% of all genes, depending on the species3–6. Because shared upstream regulators can ensure correlated gene expression, the selective advantage of maintaining adjacent gene pairs remains unknown6. Here, using two linked zebrafish segmentation clock genes, her1 and her7, and combining single-cell transcript counting, genetic engineering, real-time imaging and computational modelling, we show that gene pairing boosts correlated transcription and provides phenotypic robustness for the formation of developmental patterns. Our results demonstrate that the prevention of gene pairing disrupts oscillations and segmentation, and the linkage of her1 and her7 is essential for the development of the body axis in zebrafish embryos. We predict that gene pairing may be similarly advantageous in other organisms, and our findings could lead to the engineering of precise synthetic clocks in embryos and organoids.},

	abstract = {During embryogenesis, the processes that control how cells differentiate and interact to form particular tissues and organs with precise timing and shape are of fundamental importance. One prominent example of such processes is vertebrate somitogenesis, which is governed by a molecular oscillator called the segmentation clock. The segmentation clock system is initiated in the presomitic mesoderm in which a set of genes and signaling pathways exhibit coordinated spatiotemporal dynamics to establish regularly spaced boundaries along the body axis; these boundaries provide a blueprint for the development of segment-like structures such as spines and skeletal muscles. The highly complex and dynamic nature of this in vivo event and the design principles and their regulation in both normal and abnormal embryogenesis are not fully understood. Recently, live-imaging has been used to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of selected components of the circuit, particularly in combination with well-designed experiments to perturb the system. Here, we review recent progress from studies using live imaging and manipulation, including attempts to recapitulate the segmentation clock in vitro. In combination with mathematical modeling, these techniques have become essential for disclosing novel aspects of the clock.},

	abstract = {Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the growing vertebrate body relies on the segmentation clock, a multi-cellular oscillating genetic network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding similarity in the relative slowing of oscillations and arrest in concert with differentiation. This shows that cell-extrinsic signals are not required by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. We show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.},

Genes belonging to the Hes/her family encode the only conserved oscillating genes in all analyzed vertebrate species. Hes/Her proteins form dimers and negatively autoregulate their own transcription. Here, we developed a stochastic two-dimensional multicellular computational model to elucidate how the dynamics, i.e. period, amplitude and synchronization, of the segmentation clock are regulated. We performed parameter searches to demonstrate that autoregulatory negative-feedback loops of the redundant repressor Her dimers can generate synchronized gene expression oscillations in wild-type embryos and reproduce the dynamics of the segmentation oscillator in different mutant conditions. Our model also predicts that synchronized oscillations can be robustly generated as long as the half-lives of the repressor dimers are shorter than 6 minutes. We validated this prediction by measuring, for the first time, the half-life of Her7 protein as 3.5 minutes. These results demonstrate the importance of building biologically realistic stochastic models to test biological models more stringently and make predictions for future experimental studies.},

These ectomesenchymal derivatives play a critical role in the formation of the vertebrate head, and are thought to be a key attribute at the center of vertebrate evolution and diversity. Further, aberrant neural crest cell development and differentiation is the root cause of many human pathologies, including cancers, rare syndromes, and birth malformations.

Following their initial discovery, a substantial amount of information has been gained regarding the roles Hox genes play in various physiologic and pathologic processes. These processes range from a central role in anterior–posterior patterning of the developing embryo to roles in oncogenesis that are yet to be fully elucidated. In vertebrates there are a total of 39 Hox genes divided into 4 separate clusters. Of these, mutations in 10 Hox genes have been found to cause human disorders with significant variation in their inheritance patterns, penetrance, expressivity and mechanism of pathogenesis. This review aims to describe the various phenotypes caused by germline mutation in these 10 Hox genes that cause a human phenotype, with specific emphasis paid to the genotypic and phenotypic differences between allelic disorders. As clinical whole exome and genome sequencing is increasingly utilized in the future, we predict that additional Hox gene mutations will likely be identified to cause distinct human phenotypes. As the known human phenotypes closely resemble gene-specific murine models, we also review the homozygous loss-of-function mouse phenotypes for the 29 Hox genes without a known human disease. This review will aid clinicians in identifying and caring for patients affected with a known Hox gene disorder and help recognize the potential for novel mutations in patients with phenotypes informed by mouse knockout studies.},

We have isolated a zebrafish deficiency, b567, that deletes two linked her genes, her1 and her7. Homozygous b567 mutants have defective somites along the entire embryonic axis. Injection of a combination of her1 and her7 (her1+7) morpholino modified antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) phenocopies the b567 mutant somitic phenotype, indicating that her1 and her7 are necessary for normal somite formation and that defective somitogenesis in b567 mutant embryos is due to deletion of her1 and her7. Analysis at the cellular level indicates that somites in her1+7-deficient embryos are enlarged in the anterior-posterior dimension. Weak somite boundaries are often found within these enlarged somites which are delineated by stronger, but imperfect, boundaries. In addition, the anterior-posterior polarity of these enlarged somites is disorganized. Analysis of her1 MO-injected embryos and her7 MO-injected embryos indicates that although these genes have partially redundant functions in most of the trunk region, her1 is necessary for proper formation of the anteriormost somites and her7 is necessary for proper formation of somites posterior to somite 11. By following somite development over time, we demonstrate that her genes are necessary for the formation of alternating strong somite boundaries. Thus, even though two potential downstream components of Notch signaling are lacking in her1+7-deficient embryos, somite boundaries form, but do so with a one and a half to two segment periodicity.},

We developed a platform of transgenic organisms, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and optimized image analysis that enables visualization and quantification of MS2 reporters. We used these tools to obtain the first single-cell, real-time measurements of transcriptional dynamics of the segmentation clock. Our measurements challenge the traditional view of smooth clock oscillations and instead suggest a model of discrete transcriptional bursts that are organized in space and time.
