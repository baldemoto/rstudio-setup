## Some Important Literature

-   This reference shows how stochasticity in gene expression for the mutual repressor her1/her7 proteins is leveraged to produce robust somite patterning in embryos. [@keseroglu_stochastic_2023]

-   This reference was one of the first articles to show that her1 and her7 act in unison to coordinate the activity of the segmentation clock through autorepressive means. [@henry_two_2002]

## A cool equation or two

$$
\sum_{k=1}^5(k^2+2) = (1^2+2)+(2^2+2)+(3^2+2)+(4^2+2)+(5^2+2)\\ = 3+6+11+18+27\\ = 65.
$$
